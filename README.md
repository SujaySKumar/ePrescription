Android App for online prescriptions

ePrescription is an Android App that moves the whole process of medical consultation and prescriptions
right into your phone. The prescriptions are stored digitally in the phone which eliminates problems like
misplacement of prescriptions, illegible hand writing etc by storing the entire history of every prescription
written out to the patient. Includes an inbuilt feature of Google Search, video call and appointment scheduling.
